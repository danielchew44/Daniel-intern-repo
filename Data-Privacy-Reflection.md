üõ†Ô∏è Task

Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
One habit I can adopt to improve data security in my role is regularly reviewing and updating access permissions for sensitive data and systems. This practice involves:

Auditing access: Routinely checking who has access to sensitive data and ensuring that only those who truly need it for their job are authorized to view or handle it.

Revoking unnecessary access: When employees change roles or leave the organization, ensuring their access is promptly revoked to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

Using least privilege principle: Assigning the minimum level of access necessary for individuals to complete their tasks, reducing the exposure of sensitive data.

By adopting this practice, I can help ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to the right people and minimize the risk of accidental or malicious data breaches. Regularly updating permissions also helps in maintaining compliance with privacy regulations and security best practices.
Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
One key security measure I will implement is enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all accounts that support it.

MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring not only a password but also a second form of verification (e.g., a code from an authenticator app or a fingerprint). This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if a password is compromised. It‚Äôs a simple yet highly effective step to improve overall security hygiene.
