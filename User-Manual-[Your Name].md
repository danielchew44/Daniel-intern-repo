User Manual for Xianpei
My Role
I am working as an Agile Project Manager.
My working hours are 10:00 AM ‚Äì 6:00 PM AEST.
How I Work Best
I do my best work when I have clear expectations and examples (such as previous work samples). Having a to-do list and a well-structured schedule also helps me stay on track.
I struggle when there is a lack of clear direction or instructions in areas unfamiliar to me (such as front-end development or manual testing, which are new to me).
Communication Style
I prefer messages to be direct, with enough detail when necessary. If a task requires context, I appreciate well-structured written communication.
The best way to reach me is via Discord messages.
If you need something urgent, feel free to talk to me directly. If it‚Äôs extremely urgent, a quick call is best.
Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when there is open, respectful communication and a collaborative approach to problem-solving. I appreciate a balance between independence and teamwork.
My biggest pet peeves in teamwork are unclear instructions and a lack of accountability.
If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am processing the discussion or ensuring I fully understand the topic before contributing.
Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by creating structured to-do lists, setting clear goals, and listening to chill music.
Things that distract me include excessive notifications, last-minute changes, and unclear priorities.
The best way to support my productivity is to provide clear expectations and structured feedback.
Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be constructive, direct, and specific, with examples when necessary. I appreciate both public and private feedback, as long as feedback is constructive, reasonable, and beneficial for both the individual and the company, I am open to receiving and implementing it.
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is to address it directly, explain the issue clearly, and suggest how I can improve. A solution-oriented approach works best for me. I appreciate it when teammates are open to collaboration, share knowledge, and provide constructive feedback in a positive and professional manner.
Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is that I may seem talkative at times, but when I‚Äôm focused, I prefer to work quietly.
A fun fact about me is that I consistently practice meditation to reduce stress and avoid emotional influence when trading equities.
My work superpower is always being willing to lend a helping hand to my teammates, and I always highly value feedback and recommendations from others, as I have learned a lot from my previous mentors and supervisors.
