Research what causes merge conflicts in Git.

Create a merge conflict in your test repo by:
Creating a branch and editing a file.
Switching back to main, making a conflicting edit in the same file, and committing it.
Merging the branch back into main.

Use your Git desktop client to resolve the conflict.

Write about your experience in git_understanding.md:
