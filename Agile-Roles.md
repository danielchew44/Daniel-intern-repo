Great question — Agile teams thrive when everyone knows their role and how they contribute to delivering value. Here's a breakdown of the key roles and what each one typically does:

👩‍💻 Developers (Engineers)
Build and implement features, fix bugs, and write clean, maintainable code.

Collaborate on architecture, design, and implementation decisions.

Work closely with QA and PMs to ensure the product meets requirements.

In Agile, developers are often cross-functional — not just coders, but full participants in planning and continuous improvement.

🧪 QA (Quality Assurance)
Test features to ensure they work correctly and meet acceptance criteria.

Create and run manual or automated tests.

Catch issues before release, and help maintain overall quality and stability.

Often involved early (shift-left testing) to collaborate with devs on defining clear, testable requirements.

📌 Product Manager (PM)
Owns the product vision and roadmap — defines what gets built and why.

Maintains the product backlog, prioritizing tasks based on value, urgency, and impact.

Collaborates closely with stakeholders, customers, and the team to ensure alignment.

Acts as the voice of the customer, balancing user needs with business goals.

🎯 Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) / Scrum Master (in Scrum)
Focuses on process, facilitation, and removing blockers.

Helps the team stay on track, follow Agile practices, and improve over time.

Supports planning, standups, retrospectives, and ensures healthy team dynamics.

In smaller teams, this role might be combined with another (e.g., the PM or a senior dev).

🤝 Other Supporting Roles
🧠 Stakeholders
Anyone invested in the project (e.g., leadership, customers, partners).

Provide input, feedback, and priorities to guide development.

Should stay engaged throughout the project, not just at the end.

🎨 UX/UI Designers
Design user-centered experiences, workflows, and interfaces.

Collaborate with PMs and devs to align designs with product goals and technical feasibility.

Often work ahead of sprints ("design one step ahead") to give the team a clear vision to build from.

🛠️ Customer Support / Success
Bring in real-world feedback from users.

Help the team understand pain points, feature requests, and common issues.

Act as a bridge between users and the product team.

TL;DR:
Agile teams thrive when developers, QA, PMs, and supporting roles work collaboratively — sharing responsibility for delivering high-quality, valuable outcomes early and often.

How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
Great question! While the roles themselves don’t change much between Kanban and Scrum, the way they collaborate and organize work does vary depending on the framework.

Here’s a comparison of how these roles typically collaborate in Scrum vs. Kanban:

🌀 In Scrum (structured, sprint-based)
Role	Collaboration Style
Developers	Work in time-boxed sprints, commit to a sprint backlog, participate in daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
QA	Embedded in the team, test features during the sprint, help define “done,” and ensure quality before sprint review.
Product Manager (PM) / Product Owner	Maintains the product backlog, works with the team during sprint planning to define priorities, reviews work during sprint review.
Scrum Master / Agile PM	Facilitates all Scrum ceremonies, removes blockers, ensures Scrum principles are followed, promotes continuous improvement.
UX / Stakeholders / Support	Often involved during sprint planning and reviews; provide feedback and clarification before or after sprints. UX may work slightly ahead.
📊 In Kanban (continuous flow, no sprints)
Role	Collaboration Style
Developers	Pull tasks from the Kanban board as capacity allows, focus on flow and finishing tasks before starting new ones.
QA	Also pull work from the board, often test in parallel with devs, may set up their own columns (e.g., “Ready for QA,” “In QA”).
Product Manager (PM)	Continuously prioritizes the backlog; adjusts work order and adds tasks based on customer needs and team capacity.
Agile PM	Monitors flow metrics (e.g., cycle time), facilitates regular check-ins (not necessarily formal ceremonies), helps resolve bottlenecks.
UX / Stakeholders / Support	Collaborate asynchronously; can continuously feed insights or updates to the board. UX work may be tracked in its own swimlane.
🔍 Summary of Key Differences:
Aspect	Scrum	Kanban
Work Style	Time-boxed (sprints)	Continuous flow
Planning	Sprint planning every 1–4 weeks	Continuous prioritization
Cadence	Set meetings: planning, standup, review, retro	Flexible, based on team needs
Commitment	Team commits to sprint goals	No fixed commitments — work pulled as capacity allows
Focus	Sprint goals and velocity	Flow efficiency, cycle time, WIP limits
TL;DR:
Scrum teams collaborate around structured sprints and ceremonies.
Kanban teams collaborate more fluidly, pulling work and adjusting priorities as needed — ideal for continuous delivery.
