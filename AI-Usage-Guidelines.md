AI Usage Guidelines
1. AI for Assistance:
I use AI primarily as a learning tool and productivity aid rather than a shortcut to bypass effort. My standard for whether it is right or wrong to use AI is based on its long-term benefits‚Äîif it helps me grow and improve my skills, then it is a valuable tool. If I already have the skills to solve a problem, I usually do not rely on AI, or I may use it as a secondary check for minor issues like grammar or typos.

2. Avoiding Over-Reliance:
As mentioned above, I believe AI should be used in ways that support long-term learning and skill development rather than as a complete replacement for human effort. If AI helps me and my team acquire new skills, improve efficiency, or reduce unnecessary learning costs, then it is a useful tool rather than an over-reliance. Therefore, it is crucial to treat AI as a learning companion, not as a substitute for critical thinking and problem-solving.

3. Data Privacy:
I am cautious about data privacy and avoid sharing any personal information, client data, or company-owned intellectual property (including confidential information and proprietary code) with AI tools. I ensure that all AI interactions comply with security policies and best practices, and I prefer using AI solutions that prioritize user privacy and data security.
