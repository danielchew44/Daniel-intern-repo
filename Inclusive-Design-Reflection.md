Inclusive-Design-Reflection
1. Communication style for neurodivergent users
I would use a more inclusive style of language overall. If talking to my colleague, I will ask in a polite way and try not to be pushy. Additionally, I will provide clear, structured communication and allow extra processing time when necessary, ensuring that instructions or feedback are easy to understand.

2. Pitfalls
If communicating with neurodivergent users, I tend to use a less strong enforcing reminder like pop-up windows. Instead, I would use a message or notification to let them know so they may feel less stress and be less impulsive. A better approach might be to provide a gentler reminder rather than forcing a justification. Focus Bear now takes up to two steps to be turned off (exit button -> choose a reason why to turn off). I think this design may cause frustration or resistance, leading to a negative attitude toward the app and decreasing loyalty and retention.

3. Practical changes
I can advocate for clearer, more detailed instructions within my work, ensuring that information is accessible and easy to process for all coworkers.

Task: Identify One Design or Communication Improvement to Make Focus Bear More Accessible
Reducing the frequency of pop-up windows and replacing them with gentler, less intrusive notifications would improve accessibility. This would help users stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed or interrupted too frequently.
